When we are able to express ourselves in an uncomplicated and trusting manner all things are resolved with ease. This essence eliminates projections and helps us to come from our inner 'light' being.

Light always dispels the darkness.", "This is an uplifting remedy which allows us to stay in our god-ness.

It is a remedy for recognizing the little voice of the super ego - all the 'oughts' and 'shoulds' and being able to turn into what I really want.
