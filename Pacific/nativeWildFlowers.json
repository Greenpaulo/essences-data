It allows us to step out from the imagined comfort of being in the crowd and to express our own uniqueness. It fortifies our courage to 'follow our bliss.'", "The violet blue colour of Bluebell resonates with the Throat chakra, the centre of self-expression. It is effective for emotionally caused speech disorders and autistic behaviour patterns. It combats shyness and that feeling of discomfort that arises when we feel unable to make ourselves understood or when we are afraid of being judged.", "At a physical level this remedy affects problems related to deficient energy in the Lung and Kidney channels. It boosts low energy and combats fatigue. It promotes the ability to breathe during panic or anxiety attacks.

In order to live fully we need to feel able to move effortlessly between logic and intuition.", "The Solar Plexus chakra stores memory from previous incarnations.

The residual primal fear stored in the third chakra/Solar Plexus prevents them from feeling comfortable with intuition. Blue Camas does not necessarily release the fear, but it does prevent it from interfering with access to the whole brain.
