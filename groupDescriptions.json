    "description":["This collection of 24 wild flowers is a representative sampling of the energy of Vancouver Island and the Pacific Northwest. It includes the brilliant oranges of the Arbutus tree, and the magenta haze of Fireweed. The flowers come from roadside ditches - Blue Lupin, and from the depths of cedar and pine forests - Candystick.", "Many of these plants were used by the Indians as food supply - Salal, Blue Camas, Hooker's Onion. Some were used in a medicinal fashion - Pipsissewa for kidney problems, Plantain poultices applied externally to draw out toxins, Nootka Rose hips as a source of vitamin C.", "They interact with many aspects of the human energy system and offer healing of the heart, mind and spirit. These plants embody the unique and ancient vibration of the Pacific Northwest and we are proud to offer them as our contribution to the global endeavour of flower essence therapy."],
